 tgpt "En Emacs 29.4 en Guix OS, dentro de una VM Qemu, hago guix pull y guix package -u y me pregunto, comparado con apt, por qué diantres tarda tanto en actualizar cada vez el sistema? y eso que no hice todavía guix system reconfigure /etc/config.scm... Es normal que sea mucho más lento actualizar cada día que un apt o un pacman? no sé si gentoo no es más rápido para hacer los updates"

Based on the search results, there are several reasons why Guix may be slower than apt or pacman when updating:

1. Package verification: Guix performs extensive checks on all packages during updates, which adds time but ensures security.

2. Source-based distribution: Guix builds packages from source each time, while apt and pacman often use pre-built binaries.

3. Dependency resolution: Guix resolves dependencies more thoroughly, potentially taking longer.

4. System configuration changes: Guix updates system configurations along with packages, adding complexity.

5. Network operations: Guix downloads sources for every package, even if not changed, unlike apt's partial updates.

6. Build process: Guix rebuilds package, while apt often only replaces files.

7. Complexity of Nix expressions: Guix uses Nix expressions for package management, which can be computationally intensive.

While Gentoo may have similar performance issues due to its source-based nature, it typically doesn't perform as many checks as Guix. However, both systems prioritize security over speed in their update processes.

To improve Guix update speed:

1. Use guix pull --no-grafts to skip grafting (downloading sources).
2. Consider using guix system reconfigure periodically instead of daily updates.
3. Optimize your system configuration to reduce unnecessary updates.

Remember that while Guix prioritizes security and reproducibility, this comes at the cost of potentially slower updates compared to other package managers.Here are some tips to improve Guix update speed:

1. Use guix pull --no-grafts to skip downloading package sources and only update metadata [0].

2. Enable client-side adaptive compression selection by configuring guix-daemon to use zstd compression, which is faster to decompress than gzip/lzip [0].

3. Use local substitutes by enabling the --discover option on the Guix daemon to discover and use nearby substitute servers [0].

4. Avoid frequent small updates and instead do larger updates less frequently using guix system reconfigure [0].

5. Disable RLE encoding on pixelmaps and images that need to render quickly [2].

6. Ensure DMA2D acceleration is enabled in the display driver [2].

7. Use 24-bit xRGB framebuffer format if available, as it can be faster for alpha blending [2].

8. Check that the display driver callback assignment is properly set up to enable parallel rendering [2].

9. Verify data cache is enabled on the CPU [2].

10. For large upgrades, consider using guix system reconfigure instead of individual package updates [3].

The key is to minimize network downloads, leverage caching, and enable hardware acceleration where possible. Experiment with different settings to find the optimal balance of speed and reliability for your use case.
